# H--gg
This is an university project (prof. Magnea and Uccirati from University of Torino are supervisors)
The target is to obtain the amplitude of the process h->gg (Higgs boson decay in two gluons)

![alt text][gg->h]

For sake of simplicity, only the _top_ quark loop is considered, since it gives the dominant effect.

The amplitude is first computed using the Feynman parameters and master integrals, then a numerical method is used to compute the scalar integrals, for different values of energy of the gluons emitted. 
The results are finally plotted for different energies of the Higgs.
