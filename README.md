# H--gg
This is an university project. 
The target is to obtain the amplitude of the process gg->h (two gluons produce a Higgs boson)

![alt text][gg->h]

For sake of simplicity, only the _top_ quark loop is considered, since it gives the dominant effect.

The amplitude is first computed using the Feynman parameters and master integrals, then a numerical method is used to compute the scalar integrals, which are factors of the different tensorial terms in the amplitude. 

To run the code, 
`source run.sh`
